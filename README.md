# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is about the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Files

CodeBook.md is a text file that that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

run_analysis.R prepares the data. Five processes outlined in the course project's definition:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final exported data is "tidyData.txt".
